# noise_raster

This repository contains python code to:

1. validate source raster data
2. resample source raster data with different resolutions
3. reproject source raster data to EPSG:3035 [in progress]
4. energetically add raster data from different noise sources [in progress]
5. vectorize added raster data [in progress]
6. topologically validate vectorized data
